# Segmentation
Segmentation of graffiti images using opencv2

- You start at AytA.py. 
- A general segmentation OCR form that uses openCV to create per line text image that can be used for HTR then.
- There are several images that have been tested, and raw results are uploaded as interpreted text for further acts. 
- There are also more images that can be used for a more general purpose to be illustrated.



Then you expect for the files on files folder to obtain sembling expressions as to these included in such
The results from images added on files and used as per segmentation from AutA.py are interpreted here.



- A neuron was not necessary to segmentate, although some might have thought so....
The justification of the statement comes from the book of Induction: Choice and Chance of Bryan Skryms. 
Simply put that humans can never predict their justification of a graffiti pattern based on their stack of knowledge ascociated info. A new pattern always emerges, and that is the baseline for error introduction....


- Point being: it s not possible to segmentate segment of segments. 
- More images can be tested altering variable jpeg on AutA.py.



        AutA.py Seemed to be the golden segmentation ratio regarding y axis. 


- Input is image.jpg
- Exp. output is line statements of image.jpg

- AutA, induced image to a ratio where graffiti tests seemed to provide a more unequivocal output
- OpenCV was used to reduced blurs of regarded jpgs' and apply 0/255 filter, (imported as cv2)
- Ratio that provided result for most test jpgs, was determined and used to scale in order to pre-apply for cv2 manipulation
- Images are segmentated to baseline accordeing to Y axis using the original jpeg variable input but regarded to the manipulated cv2 jpg to yield best forms for output
- outputs for several tests are demonstrated in the main folder.
